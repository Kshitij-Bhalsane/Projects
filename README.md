Self Made Projects made while learning Something New

**📝 Efficient Text Editor**
A lightweight and user-friendly text editor built with Java Swing. This simple application allows users to open, edit, and save .txt files with ease. Designed for efficiency and simplicity, it provides the essential features of a notepad in a clean graphical interface.

_✨ Features_
📂 Open plain text (.txt) files
💾 Save text to a file
🧹 Auto-clears the editor before loading new files
🖥️ Responsive UI with scrollable text area
❌ Exit option for quick closing
📁 File chooser with .txt file filtering

_🛠️ Built With_
Java 17+
Swing (Java's built-in GUI framework)

**🧭 Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer**
An interactive and minimalist visualizer for pathfinding algorithms built with Python and Pygame. This tool provides a hands-on way to understand how various algorithms traverse a grid to find the shortest path between two points — complete with real-time animations and user interaction.

_🔍 Algorithms Implemented : _
A* (A-Star)
BFS (Breadth-First Search)
DFS (Depth-First Search)
Dijkstra’s Algorithm

_🎮 Controls & Features_
🟠 Start Node – Left-click to place
🔷 End Node – Left-click to place
⬛ Barriers – Left-click to place (after setting start/end)
❌ Remove Node – Right-click to remove any placed node
🧠 SPACE – Begin visualizing the selected pathfinding algorithm
♻️ C – Clear the grid
⬅️ ESC – Return to the algorithm selection menu
📏 Real-time step-by-step visualization
🧩 Clickable GUI for choosing the algorithm
🖼️ UI Layout
2×2 button menu to choose algorithms

_Clean, responsive grid with colorful node states:_
🟠 Start
🔷 End
⬛ Barrier
🟥 Visited
🟩 Open
🟣 Final Path
💡 Purpos

This project is aimed at students, developers, and curious learners who want to see how search algorithms work behind the scenes. 
It’s perfect for algorithm visualization, educational demonstrations, and DSA learning!
